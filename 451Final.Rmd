According to the paper "The Effect of Aid on Growth: Evidence from a Quasi-Experiment" by Galiani, we choose GDP growth rate as the measurement for economic impact and incorporate the population growth rate in our model. However, since we would do our analysis for a particular year (2012), we would not follow their model but build our own based on the causal discovery and pre-existing knowledge. 

First, let’s have a look at the data set.

+ `country`: recipient country
+ `year`: year
+ `US_ODA`: U.S. Official development assistance(treatment), defined as government aid designed to promote the economic development and welfare of developing countries[1]. 
+ `US_OOF`: U.S. Other Official Flows, transactions by the official sector with countries on the List of Aid Recipients which do not meet the conditions for eligibility as Official Development Assistance or Official Aid. 
+ `US_aid_total`: U.S. total aid the recipient received.
+ `Rest_of_world_ODA`: ODA except for U.S. and China(data of China is largely missing) the recipient received.
+ `Rest_of_world_OOF`: OOF except for U.S. and China(data of China is largely missing) the recipient received.
+ `Rest_of_world_aid_total`: rest of world total recipient received.
+ `polity2`:Recipient Polity Score,  "-10 (hereditary monarchy) to +10 (consolidated democracy)"
+ `oda_gni`: ODA in percentage in gross national income of the recipient's.
+ `population`:the total population of the recipient in that year.
+ `recipient_trade_world`:Recipient Total Trade with World
+ `GDP_per_growth_rate`: Recipient's GDP Per Capita growth rate, calculated by (this year - previous year)/previous year.
+ `GDP_total_growth_rate`: Recipient's total GDP growth rate, calculated by (this year - previous year)/previous year.
+ `population_growth_rate`: Recipient's Population growth rate, calculated by (this year - previous year)/previous year.

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
aid = read.csv("processed.csv")
aid$GDP_total_growth_rate = as.double(aid$GDP_total_growth_rate)
head(aid)
```
First, let's visualize the distribution of the missing data.

```{r echo=FALSE}
vis_miss(aid)
vis_miss(aid,cluster = TRUE)
```

we decide to drop the observations that have missing values for the following reason:

1. "MNAR: Missing Not at Random - the missing is not random, it correlates with unobservable characteristics unknown to a researcher." The missing rows gather around the last 400 rows, so we cannot assume the missing is at random. 

2. we can afford to drop 7.7% of the original data as we still have 92.3% data left.

To get away with the time correlated concern, we decide to base our analysis on 2007 and 2012 because they have the least missing data. We conduct analysis on one of them, and use the result of the other one  to compare, which serves as a part of sensitive analysis to test the robustness of the former.

```{r}
aid = aid %>%
  na.omit(aid)

aid2007 = aid %>%
  filter(year==2007)

aid2012 = aid %>%
  filter(year==2012)
```

}
")
plot(dag)
```

The causal graph is constructed based on our prior assumptions and common sense:

1. The outcome(Y: GDP growth rate of the recipient) depends on the national demand, population growth rate, the foreign aid received, potentially its autocracy-democracy index(polity2), and the recipient’s openness (measured by its global trade).

2. We assume that our treatment, US ODA, affect the outcome via direct effect(the recipient receives the aid) and indirect effect of ODA_GNI. The idea for GNI is that given the same amount of foreign aid, if the aid amounts to a large portion of the recipient’s gross national income, this aid should have a larger impact on the recipient. A similar idea applies to the foreign aid provided by the rest of the world.

3. We assume the recipient country’s openness to global trading contributes to not only GDP growth but also the amount of aid it’s going to receive. The rationale behind the assumption is the potential economic welfare gains from an aid could strongly motivate the donor. For example, the donor might want to have an impact on, or take a share of, the recipient’s market. Finally, we think it’s reasonable to assume that national demand affects the recipient’s global trade.

4. The assumption we made polity2 a confounder that has an impact on a wide range of other variables. The rationale behind this assumption is that the donors might also be motivated by enlarging their political impact on the recipient, such as winning over political support. 

# Causal Discovery

The causal graph was constructed based on our prior knowledge, which entails that the relationship assumed could be inaccurate. Therefore, we adopt causal discovery algorithm to generate causal graphs which help us identify causal flows.

The core idea of the algorithm is that if conditional on all possible sets of other variables, there remains a significant relationship between variable A and B, then there exists a direct causal association between them. The direction of the arrow is determined by controlling the middle variable for every three connected variables.

alpha is the threshold for the signifiance level. If 

- alpha = 0: holding an extremely high bar for an estimate of ACE to be counted as significant. No edge will be present in the resulted graph. 

- alpha = 1: any relationship between nodes is considered to be valid and real. The resulted graph skeleton will be strongly connected.

### alpha = 0.01

```{r}
causalAid = aid2012 %>%
  dplyr::select(-X,-country,-year)
suff_stat <- list(C = cor(causalAid), n = nrow(causalAid))
pc_aid <- pc(suff_stat, indepTest = gaussCItest, labels = colnames(causalAid), alpha = 0.01, skel.method = "stable.fast")

plot(pc_aid, main = "")
```

With a threshold of 0.01, the outcome is entirely seperated from the rest of variables. Therefore, we believe 0.01 is too strict and thus relax it to 0.05.

### alpha=0.05
```{r}
pc_aid <- pc(suff_stat, indepTest = gaussCItest, labels = colnames(causalAid), alpha = 0.05, skel.method = "stable.fast")
plot(pc_aid, main = "")
```

### alpha=0.12
```{r}
pc_aid <- pc(suff_stat, indepTest = gaussCItest, labels = colnames(causalAid), alpha = 0.12, skel.method = "stable.fast")
plot(pc_aid, main = "")
```

Comparing the resulted causal graph with our assumptions, we spot the following causal flow that we didn't identify before:


1. it's mainly ODA, instead of OOF, that contributes to other variables. For example, the graph shows that US_ODA has a direct effect on popolucation growth rate, which stimulates GDP growth. Rest_of_Work_ODA also contributes to population, which directly affects recipient's world trade. 
2. US_ODA has a direct effect on Rest_of_Work_ODA.
3. oda_gni directly affects recipient_trade_world.

As we relax the treshold from 0.01 to 0.12, there are a few changes we think might be of interests:

1. when threshold is 0.01, recipient_trade_world contributes to population. When threshold increases, it's polulation contributes to recipient_trade_world. Therefore, both directions worth exploring in our later sensitivity analysis.
2. when threshold increases to 0.12, polity2 is considered to contribute to population growth. 

It appears that the way variables affect the outcome is via population growth.

# Model Construction informed by causal discovery

Informed by the causal discovery algorithm, we visualize the relationships that are suggested by the causal discovery algorithm in the below section.

We'd like to see 

 1. Since the generated causal graph suggests `US_ODA` $\rightarrow$ `Rest_of_World_ODA` and no arrow point from `Rest_of_World_ODA` to the outcome, which is counterintuitive. we'd like to see the relationship between `US_ODA`, `Rest_of_World_ODA`, and the growth rate outcome. 
 
 2. We were surprised to see the causal graph doesn't discern a significant causal flow from `Rest_of_World_ODA` to the outcome, so we want to visually check if `Rest_of_World_ODA` is indeed not a mediator, aka if `Rest_of_World_ODA` doesn't directly contribute to the outcome. 
 
 3. When we relax the alpha threshold, we observe that `polity2` and `US_ODA` now both contribute to the outcome. This is consistent with our prior knowledge. Therefore, we want to check if we should introduce interaction term for `polity2` and `US_ODA`. Interaction term means given the same `US_ODA`, if the recipient will have different growth because they have different  `polity2`. In other words, if the recipient will react differently towards the same treatment.

#####  US_ODA,Rest_of_World_ODA, and GDP_total_growth_rate 

How GDP_total_growth_rate is affected by US_ODA and Rest_of_world_ODA?

```{r}
ggplot(data = aid2012, aes(x = US_ODA, y = GDP_total_growth_rate)) +
    geom_point(aes(color = Rest_of_world_ODA), size = 2) +
    geom_smooth(se = FALSE, color = "blue")+
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0,1000))+
  scale_color_gradient(low = "yellow", high = "darkblue")
```

From the plot, we can tell `U.S. ODA` and `rest of world ODA` are correlated, which verifies the generated causal graph. Looking at the y-axis of the plot, the ligher colored points mainly gathered at the bottom while darker ones take the upper part. We vaguely get a sense that both world ODA and U.S. ODA positively contribute to GDP total growth rate, but we admit that `rest of world ODA`'s contribution(pattern of the color) is unobvious.

Observing the effect of `U.S. ODA`, there seem to be an increasing trend between 0-250, and another decreasing trend for `US_ODA` that's larger than 250. 
Instead of keep using continuous value for treatment, we decide to cut `U.S ODA` into two categories: [0,250] and [251,+). 

```{r}
aid2012 <- aid2012%>%
  mutate(US_ODA_C = ifelse(US_ODA<250, 0,1))
```


##### Does Rest_of_world_ODA_total affect the outcome?

```{r}
ggplot(data = aid2012, aes(x = Rest_of_world_aid_total, y = GDP_total_growth_rate)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(se = FALSE, color = "blue")+
    geom_smooth(formula = y~ns(x,2), method = "lm",
        se = FALSE, color = "red"
    )+
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0,2000))
```

Earlier, we didn't see a causal flow from `rest of world aid` to the outcome, which is implausible from common sense. However, the seemingly positive slope of the bluel line suggests that greater `Rest_of_world_ODA_total` has slightly higher growth rate, although it's clearly insignificant. However, we are still justified to believe `rest of world aid` *might* open a causal path: `US_ODA` $\rightarrow$ `rest of world aid`$\rightarrow$ `GDP_total_growth_rate`.

##### Does polity2 interact with US_ODA?

```{r}
ggplot(data = aid2012, aes(x = US_ODA, y =polity2 )) +
    geom_point(aes(color = GDP_total_growth_rate), size = 2) +
  scale_color_gradient(low = "yellow", high = "darkblue")+
    geom_smooth(se = FALSE, color = "blue")+
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0,1000))
```

The colored scatter points don't seem to form a clear pattern. Therefore we DON't assume an interaction between polity2 and US_ODA.

## Regression Model

### Regression Results and Interpretation

We want to see if the variables selected should be linear or not; therefore, we would first investigate the association between the controlled variables and the outcome to decide if we want to introduce non-linearity in our regression. However, we would also build a linear model as comparison for us make a final choice between those two models. 

#### Choice of Linearity for the controlled variables

##### 1. Population growth rate vs. GDP growth rate
```{r}
ggplot(data = aid2012, aes(x = population_growth_rate, y = GDP_total_growth_rate )) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, color = "blue")+ 
  geom_smooth(formula = y~ns(x,3), method = "lm",
    method.args = list(family="binomial"),
    se = FALSE, color = "red" )
```

According to the graph above, we might incorporate population growth rate as an non-linear variable in our model. 

##### 2. Trade balance of recipient countries vs. GDP growth rate

```{r}
ggplot(data = aid2012, aes(x =log(recipient_trade_world), y = GDP_total_growth_rate )) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, color = "blue")+ 
  geom_smooth(formula = y~ns(x,2), method = "lm",
    method.args = list(family="binomial"),
    se = FALSE, color = "red" )
```

Since the trade balance of the recipient countries is a relatively large number compared to the foreign aid, we use the natural log of the trade balance to see numbers on the same scale, so that our analysis would not be misled by the large numbers. In this graph, we use natrual spline to fit the data, and we can tell that the natural log of trade balance of recipient countries is non-linear. 

##### 3. Politics score vs. GDP growth rate

```{r}
ggplot(data = aid2012, aes(x = polity2, y = GDP_total_growth_rate )) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, color = "blue")+ 
  geom_smooth(formula = y~ns(x,3), method = "lm",
    method.args = list(family="binomial"),
    se = FALSE, color = "red" )
```

Similarly, we fit a non-linear model for polity score.

#### Regression Models 

##### Non-linear regression model


```{r}
mod1 <- lm(GDP_total_growth_rate~ as.factor(US_ODA_C) +ns(log(recipient_trade_world),2)+ns(polity2,3)+ns(population_growth_rate,3),data = aid2012)
summary(mod1)
confint(mod1)
```

According to our model, if the U.S ODA is larger than 250 million dollars, then the causal effect of that donation is -1.4542 percent less GDP growth for the recipient countries than if the recipient were receiving less donation in 2012, when we hold other variables as constant. Yet, the effect of U.S ODA is insignificant becuse the p-value for -1.4542 is 0.13322, which is way higher than the conventional p-value thresholds 0.01 or 0.05. It means we are unable to reject the null hypothesis that large donation and small donation don't make a difference in GDP growth of the recipient country. 


##### Evaluation of regression model

```{r}
results <- data.frame(resid = resid(mod1), fitted = fitted(mod1))
        ggplot(results, aes(x = fitted, y = resid)) + 
          geom_point() + 
          geom_hline(yintercept = 0)
```

In the residual plot, we can see that the residuals are assigned relatively evenly across the x-axis; also, the spread is also relatively random. Therefore, we can be confident that there is no heteroskedasticity in our model.

Besides the non-linear model, we also want to investigate the results from the linear model; and we would want to compare the residual plot and the adjusted R squared to see which model we would choose.

##### linear regression model

```{r}
linear <- lm(GDP_total_growth_rate~ as.factor(US_ODA_C)+ log(recipient_trade_world)+polity2+log(population_growth_rate),  data = aid2012)
summary(linear)
```

According to the linear model, if the U.S ODA is larger than 250 million dollars, then the causal effect of that donation is -1.44675 percent less GDP growth for the recipient countries than if the recipient were receiving less donation in 2012, when we hold other variables as constant. Yet, the effect of U.S ODA is insignificant becuse the p-value for -1.44675 is 0.122483, which is way higher than the conventional p-value thresholds. It means we are unable to reject the null hypothesis that large donation and small donation don't make a difference in GDP growth of the recipient country. 

The ACE indicated by the linear model is very close to the non-linear model. Both suggest large donation do not have as good GDP growth as the small donation. We'll discuss this counterintuitive discovery later in *sensitive analysis - unmeasured variable* section.

##### Evaluation of regression model

```{r}
results <- data.frame(resid = resid(linear), fitted = fitted(linear))
        ggplot(results, aes(x = fitted, y = resid)) + 
          geom_point() + 
          geom_hline(yintercept = 0)
```

We can see that the residual plots of the non-linear model is slightly better than that of the linear model because the residuals spread out more randomly. Also, the adjusted R squared is 0.2315 for the non-linear model which is higher than that of the linear model 0.1556 . Since the performance of the non-linear model is better, we would choose the non-linear model for our analysis and sensitivity analysis as well.  



# Sensivity Analysis

#### Another Treatment variable

Despite the fact that only U.S ODA can directly connect with the outcome according to our causal discovery, it does not necessarily suggest that other variables can not affect the outcome. Therefore, we want to investigate another potential treatment: total amount of U.S aid; and we want to see its impact on the outcome. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = aid2012, aes(x = US_aid_total, y = GDP_total_growth_rate))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth()
```

According to the graph, we might still want to cut the U.S aid total at around 250 million dollars because there is an increasing trend between 0 and 250 million dollars. 

```{r}
aid2012 <- aid2012%>%
  mutate(US_aid_total_C = ifelse(US_aid_total<250, 0,1))
```


##### 1. Population growth rate vs. GDP growth rate
```{r}
p1 <- ggplot(data = aid2012, aes(x = population_growth_rate, y = GDP_total_growth_rate )) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, color = "blue")+ 
  geom_smooth(formula = y~ns(x,3), method = "lm",
    method.args = list(family="binomial"),
    se = FALSE, color = "red" )
```

According to the graph above, we might incorporate population growth rate as an non-linear variable in our model. 

##### 2. Trade balance of recipient countries vs. GDP growth rate

```{r}
p2 <- ggplot(data = aid2012, aes(x = log(recipient_trade_world), y = GDP_total_growth_rate )) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, color = "blue")+ 
  geom_smooth(formula = y~ns(x,1), method = "lm",
    method.args = list(family="binomial"),
    se = FALSE, color = "red" )
```

##### 3. Politics score vs. GDP growth rate

```{r}
p3 <- ggplot(data = aid2012, aes(x = polity2, y = GDP_total_growth_rate )) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, color = "blue")+ 
  geom_smooth(formula = y~ns(x,3), method = "lm",
    method.args = list(family="binomial"),
    se = FALSE, color = "red" )
```

```{r}
library("gridExtra")
grid.arrange(p1,p2,p3)
```

```{r}
mod2 <- lm(GDP_total_growth_rate~ as.factor(US_aid_total_C) +log(recipient_trade_world)+ns(polity2,3)+ns(population_growth_rate,3),data = aid2012)
summary(mod2)
confint(mod2)
```

As we switch to using the total amount of U.S aid, we can see that when the total aid is smaller than 250 million dollars, the GDP growth rate would be expected to increaseby 0.5556 percent holding all else constant in 2007; however, if the aid is greater than 250 million dollars, the GDP growth rate would be -1.0671 percentage less than receiving small donations, which means large donation is less ideal as receiving small donation in regard to GDP growth. Yet, the effect is insignificant(p-value is 0.2312), so we cannot reject the null effect hypothesis. The results are consistent with our findings that use U.S ODA as the treatment. 

#### Unmeasured Variable

A common robust test is to see how an unmeasured confounder could affect the result. We recognize that the effect of foreign aid on recipient's economic growth can go through complicated paths, in addition to the ones we showed above. However, due to the lack of data and the complexity of the topic, our causal graph couldn't capture all the plausible causal relationships. Therefore, we particular need to assume the existence of an unmeasured confounder and see how it would affect our prior result.

Potential unmeasured variables could include recipient's historical development, recipient's national diplomacy, the natrual resources the land of the recipient possesses...etc.

First, we need to model the treatment US_ODA_C. To do so, we would first want to visualize the association between U.S aid and other controlled variables. The goal of visualization is to find out if the association is linear or not and if we should introduce the nonlinearity into our model. For all graphs below, blue lines are dervied from the actual data, providing insights on how a variable affects if one receives the treatment or not. The red lines are used to depict that relationship.

Since the absolute value of trade balance of recipient countries is a relative big number compared to the foreign aid, we use the natural log of the trade balance so that we are able to see numbers on the same scale, so our analysis would not be misled by the big numbers. In this graph, we can see that the natural log of trade balance of recipient countries is non-linear.

Similarly, putting population on log scale helps fitting the model.

##### US_ODA_C~log(recipient_trade_world)

```{r}
ggplot(data = aid2012, aes(x = log(recipient_trade_world), y = US_ODA_C)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, color = "blue")+ 
  geom_smooth(formula = y~ns(x,2), method = "glm",
    method.args = list(family="binomial"),
    se = FALSE, color = "red" )
```

##### US_ODA_C~polity2

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = aid2012, aes(x = polity2, y =US_ODA_C)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, color = "blue")+ 
  geom_smooth(formula = y~ns(x,3), method = "glm",
    method.args = list(family="binomial"),
    se = FALSE, color = "red" )
```

##### US_ODA_C~population

```{r}
ggplot(data = aid2012, aes(x = log(population), y = US_ODA_C))+
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, color = "blue")+ 
  geom_smooth(formula = y~ns(x,2), method = "glm",
    method.args = list(family="binomial"),
    se = FALSE, color = "red" )
```

In this graph, we can see that association between U.S ODA and politics score is non-linear; therefore, this variable should also be non-linear in our model

```{r}
sensitivity_analysis <- function(.data, model_A, model_Y, assoc_A, assoc_Y) {
    n <- nrow(.data)

    res_var_Y <- sigma(model_Y)^2

    # Compute the mean and variance of U given A and Y
    mean_U_term1 <- (assoc_A/res_var_A)*res_A
    mean_U_term2 <- (((res_var_A - assoc_A^2)*assoc_Y)/(res_var_A*res_var_Y))*res_Y
    mean_U <- mean_U_term1 + mean_U_term2

    var_U_term1 <- (res_var_A - assoc_A^2)/(res_var_A*res_var_Y)
    var_U_term2 <- res_var_Y - assoc_Y^2 + ((assoc_A*assoc_Y)^2)/res_var_A
    var_U <- var_U_term1*var_U_term2

summary(mod_Y)

```

Since the median residule for mod_A is -0.07231 and for mod_Y is -0.2106, we assume the unmeasure variable should have a positive impact on the outcome.

ggplot(sens_data, aes(x = U_A, y = estimate)) +

    geom_hline(aes(yintercept = 0), color = "black") +
    facet_wrap(~U_Y, labeller = as_labeller(prepender)) +
    labs(x = "Strength of U -> A association", y = "ACE and 95% CI")
```

The black line denotes the ACE(US_ODA that's larger than 250) under the specified U -> Y and U -> A assumption, and the grey in background indicates the range of ACE of the 95% CI. The blue line denotes the original ACE(without taking U into account).

1. Assuming the intensity range of U -> Y and U -> A are reasonable, then regardless of the presence of U, the 95% confidence range of ACE that `US_ODA` has on `GDP_total_growth_rate` is below 0, which means there is a strong evidence that when `US_ODA`is larger than 250, the growth in the recipient's contry is not as effective as `US_ODA` that's smaller or equal to 250. In other words, the hypothetical U in this case is unlikely to qualitatively change our ACE.

*This is counterintuitive, because usually we would assume more donation results in more obvious economic growth in the recipient's country. A potential explanation we come up with is that poorer pre-aid condition of the recipient results in more donation, but the donation might not be used effectively due to the poor pre-aid condition. For example, according to prior knowledge, the contries receiving the most aid are Iraq, Jordan, Syria, where the political situation is not very stable. We think this might account for the counterintuitive "more donation --> less ideal" effect.*

2. Then what effect could U have? Within each U –> Y assumptioin, the various effect magnitude U –> A seems to result in more obvious negative effect when receiving large donation versus smaller donation. Therefore, the greater effect the unmeasured variable has on Y, the less effective large donation will be comparing to small donations.

3. Within each U –> A, in general, the stronger the hypothetical effect of U –> Y, the less negative effect the large donation has on the GDP growth, but the trend is not obvious with small maginitude of U –>A. The confidence interval becomes entirely below 0 for strong U-->A, which means if the unmeasured variable affects the treatment a lot, then we are more confident in our evidence that larger donation results in less ideal GDP growth.

Therefore, our estimated ACE is quite robust even after considering a various causal flow that passes U, but insignificant.

#### Different Year (2007)

```{r}
ggplot(data = aid2007, aes(x = US_ODA, y = GDP_total_growth_rate))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth()
```


According to the graph, we might need to cut US_ODA at around 100 million dollars because there is an increasing trend before 100 million dollars.

```{r}
aid2007 <- aid2007%>%
  mutate(US_ODA_C = ifelse(US_ODA<100, 0,1))
 
```

###### 1. Population growth rate vs. GDP growth rate

```{r}
p4<- ggplot(data = aid2007, aes(x = population_growth_rate, y = GDP_total_growth_rate)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, color = "blue")+ 
  geom_smooth(formula = y~ns(x,3), method = "lm",
    method.args = list(family="binomial"),
    se = FALSE, color = "red" )
```


###### 2. Trade balance of recipient countries vs. GDP growth rate

```{r}
p5<- ggplot(data = aid2012, aes(x = log(recipient_trade_world), y = GDP_total_growth_rate)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, color = "blue")+ 
  geom_smooth(formula = y~ns(x,2), method = "lm",
    method.args = list(family="binomial"),
    se = FALSE, color = "red" )
```

###### 3. Politics score vs. GDP growth rate

```{r}
p6<- ggplot(data = aid2012, aes(x = polity2, y = GDP_total_growth_rate)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, color = "blue")+ 
  geom_smooth(formula = y~ns(x,3), method = "lm",
    method.args = list(family="binomial"),
    se = FALSE, color = "red" )
```

```{r}
library("gridExtra")
grid.arrange(p4,p5,p6)
```



```{r}
mod3 <- lm(GDP_total_growth_rate~ as.factor(US_ODA_C) +ns(log(recipient_trade_world),2)+ns(polity2,3)+ns(population_growth_rate,3),data = aid2007)
summary(mod3)
confint(mod3)
```

When we use the data from 2007, we can see that if the U.S ODA is smaller than 100 million dollars, the GDP growth rate is expected to increase by 1.04743 percent comparing to if the received U.S ODA was greater than 100 million dollars, which is to the contrary of the causal effect in 2012. However, the p-value of the causal effect indicates that the benefit is not significant, similar to the p-value in 2012. It means that even we are inclined to say that in 2007, recipients benefit more from large donations than small donations, we don't have good evidence supporting this claim.

It also makes sense that our results differ across different years because the marginal benefit of additional foreign aid is very likely to be different. Imagine that you are a investor and you are invest on a project annually, the return rate of the project at the beginning of the stage could be very high, whereas the return rate after several years may drop no matter the size of the investment. Therefore, it would be also unrealistic that the benefit of U.S ODA is constant over decades and we would expect to see fluctuations along the time line. Since the marginal benefit can differ, then the estimated contribution to the economics should also be different for each year. 


#### Another Measurement of Economic growth

```{r}
mod4 <- lm(GDP_per_growth_rate ~ as.factor(US_ODA_C) +ns(log(recipient_trade_world),2)+ns(polity2,3)+ns(population_growth_rate,3),data = aid2012)
summary(mod4)
confint(mod4)
```

We also switch to another common estimator of economic growth: GDP per capita growth rate, because a large GDP does not imply a large GDP per capita and vice versa; therefore, we want to use GDP per capita to see if our results would change substantially if we use another similar estimate of outcome. 

Interestingly, after adopting GDP per capita as our outcome, the output suggests a 0.06235 percentage increase as a result of receiving large donation versus small donation in 2012. P-value 0.00891 suggests the ACE to be significant, which means we can confidently say large donation does benefit GDP per capita more than smal donation does. 

# Limitations 

## Limited Time line
In our model, we only used data in a particular year, which might not be persuasive or representative enough for us to make strong conclusion on the impact of U.S aid. For the future study, we might want to consider using a panel dataset and a time series model, such as the mixed effect model; then we might be able to generalize our conclusion on the impact of U.S aid. 

## Other important variables
We also know that there are various type of foreign aid, ODA and OOF. Also, within ODA and OOF, there are various type of aids as well. Some are goverment grants, and others might be loans. Since there are different forms of foreign aids and their characteristics might generate different impact on the economics of the recipient countries. Therefore, we might also want to examine the impact of various types of foreign aids, which can lead us to an alternative answer.

## Causal Discovery and Regression
We used causal discovery to explore various forms of causal paths and graphs; however, we did not build our regression based on different conditional sets generated through causal discovery. Therefore, for future study, we can have different sets of conditional variables according to causal discovery and build regression models for each of those.
